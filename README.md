# Dotfiles

### Set things up

Install a few packages:

1. [wal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal) for color scheme generation
2. [haishoku](https://github.com/LanceGin/haishoku) backend for wal (via pip)
3. [compton-try-one-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compton-tryone-git/) for compton compositing with blur effects
4. [awesome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/awesome-git/) window manager
5. [IBM Plex Font](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/ttf-ibm-plex/)
6. [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) (this costs money)
7. [Nitrogen](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nitrogen)

And I imagine probably some other stuff too. This is mostly a
reference for me.

```bash
./install.sh # links a bunch of things
```
